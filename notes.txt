NOTES and for brain storming only, nothing final

Project overview
Create a “DEX aggregator” that will
automatically route the users’ input fund to any of these exchanges, for a
preferable output amount. The user should be able to use only one
transaction to finish his swap, and this transaction should be sent to
some smart contract you create.

Exchanges
VVS
MMF
