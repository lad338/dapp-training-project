NOTES and for brain storming only, nothing final

Project overview
Create a “DEX aggregator” that will
automatically route the users’ input fund to any of these exchanges, for a
preferable output amount. The user should be able to use only one
transaction to finish his swap, and this transaction should be sent to
some smart contract you create.

Exchanges
VVS
MMF

Solution 
Off chain: 
- Multicall to contracts for latest price
- DFS for token pairs to find the optimal path (also need to take extra transaction gas as calculation)
- Return the best path

On chain:
- A contract that has MMF and VVS adapter to do the swaps
- Execute the transaction with the path searched off-chain
- Transaction made with either exact input or exact output

Random NOTES
For example if I have a path A, B, C, D
if A, B is from VVS and C, D from MMF
am I suppose the call the swap token function using VVS router for A, B; then retrieve the interim amount and call MMF router for C,D?
